Hey! I am Gabin Aureche, a freelance front-end developer.

I studied web design before joining [Wizbii](https://wizbii.com) as lead front-end developer. I had the opportunity of setting up the bases for the web application. My interest in user satisfaction also led me to collaborate with the growth marketing team.

I then join [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) as product developer. I contribute to features' design and development, sometimes taking the role of the designer.

Hungry for new experiences, I start freelancing. I help one of [Cegid](https://cegid.com)'s team to set up code and design best practices on the front-end part. I then work with [Trackd√©chets](https://trackdechets.beta.gouv.fr), a state's startup from the ministry of ecology.

On my spare time I enjoy creating interactive experience and contributing to open source. I also have a passion for video games and MMA (spectator, not practitioner).
